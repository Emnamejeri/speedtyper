# speedtyper
 
SpeedTyper is a typing test application that helps users evaluate their typing skills including speed and accuracy. It allows users to practice typing by displaying a text that they must replicate within a fixed time frame. The application provides real-time feedback on user performance, saving the results across different sessions and offering analysis for improvement.

Features
Interactive Test Environment: Presents users with text to type and gives immediate feedback on correctness.
Timer Control: Implements a countdown timer to simulate a real test scenario.
Multi-Attempt Tracking: Stores and compares results from different attempts to track progress over time.
Dynamic Feedback Messages: Provides customized messages based on user's typing speed.
Session Reset: Allows users to reset the test or escape out of the current session.
Local Storage Integration: Utilizes browser's local storage to persist user attempts and display previous results.
Responsive Design: Includes UI elements that dynamically adapt to user interactions.
